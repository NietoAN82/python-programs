# Project Title

King of The Hill Website Scrape

## Description

This python program imports a list of all King of the Hill episode titles and uses it to web scrape all wiki links for each episode to gather information that is eventually extracted into a .csv file.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Libraries:
- urlopen from urllib.request: This library helps us open URLs and fetch HTML content from web pages.
- BeautifulSoup from bs4: BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, making it easier to navigate and extract data.

### Installing
Project was created in PyCharm

Delete or move the koth_data.csv file if you wish to see the csv file generated from scratch after running.
Make sure Episode Title.txt is in the same folder as the KoTH_Scrape folder.

### Executing program

Running the program should create the csv file.
